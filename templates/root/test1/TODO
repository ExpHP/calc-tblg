TODO
add these to shakefile or somehow find a way to separate the specification of the
 general methods of computation (the componentized stuff in the Shakefile)
 from how they are used (prefixes like work/ and abc/ in the makefile)

the test is that these should produce like band structures, since the two input
structures differ only by a `ddp` in vim
